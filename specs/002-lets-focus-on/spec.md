# Feature Specification: HTTP Fetch Component with Real Network Capability

**Feature Branch**: `002-lets-focus-on`  
**Created**: 2025-10-14  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "lets focus on the example-http-fetch. Id like to wrap the reqwest library to handle the http GET request. Is it possible to wrap the reqwest library in wasm component?"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Basic HTTP GET Request (Priority: P1)

A developer adds an HTTP Fetch node to their visual graph to retrieve data from a web API. They connect a URL string to the node's input, execute the graph, and receive the response body and status code as outputs that can be processed by downstream nodes.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability to make HTTP GET requests, the component has no value. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a simple graph with a Constant node (containing a URL), connecting it to the HTTP Fetch node, executing the graph, and verifying that real HTTP response data is returned.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a URL string input pointing to a valid HTTP endpoint, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the node returns the actual response body content and a valid HTTP status code (200-299 for success)
2. **Given** a secure HTTPS URL, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the node successfully handles secure connections and returns the response
3. **Given** a URL that returns JSON data, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the response body contains the complete, unmodified JSON text
4. **Given** no timeout parameter is provided, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the request uses the default 30-second timeout
5. **Given** a custom timeout value (e.g., 10 seconds) is provided as an input, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the request uses the custom timeout value
6. **Given** a URL that redirects to another URL within the same approved domain, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the redirect is followed automatically and the final response is returned
7. **Given** a URL that redirects to a different domain outside the approved capability scope, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the redirect is blocked and an error message is returned indicating the cross-domain redirect was not allowed

### User Story 2 - Error Handling for Network Failures (Priority: P2)

A developer's graph attempts to fetch from an unreachable or invalid endpoint. The HTTP Fetch node gracefully handles the error and provides clear, actionable feedback about what went wrong without crashing the graph execution.

**Why this priority**: Essential for production use - network requests commonly fail due to connectivity issues, invalid URLs, or server errors. Without proper error handling, graphs become brittle and hard to debug.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by providing invalid URLs (malformed, non-existent domains, timeout scenarios) and verifying that meaningful error messages are returned instead of crashes.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an invalid or malformed URL, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the node returns a clear error message indicating the URL format is invalid
2. **Given** a URL pointing to a non-existent domain, **When** the HTTP Fetch node attempts to connect, **Then** the node returns an error message indicating the domain could not be resolved
3. **Given** a server that returns a 404 or 500 error, **When** the HTTP Fetch node executes, **Then** the node returns the error status code and any error response body
4. **Given** a request that times out, **When** the timeout period expires, **Then** the node returns an error message indicating a timeout occurred

### User Story 3 - Capability-Based Security Approval (Priority: P2)

A developer loads the HTTP Fetch component into WasmFlow for the first time. Before the component can make network requests, the system prompts the user to review and approve the specific network domains/hosts the component is requesting access to.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical for any network-enabled component. Users need visibility and control over what external resources components can access.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by loading the component fresh (without prior approval) and verifying that network access is blocked until explicit user approval is granted.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the HTTP Fetch component declares required network capabilities in its metadata, **When** the component is loaded, **Then** the system records the capability requirements
2. **Given** a user attempts to execute the HTTP Fetch node without prior approval, **When** execution begins, **Then** the system prompts for capability approval before proceeding
3. **Given** a user approves network access to specific domains, **When** the node executes with a URL within approved scope, **Then** the request proceeds without additional prompts
4. **Given** a user denies network access, **When** the node attempts to execute, **Then** the execution fails with a clear "permission denied" error message

---

### User Story 4 - HTTP Response Headers Access (Priority: P3)

A developer needs to inspect HTTP response headers (content-type, cache-control, custom headers) for advanced use cases. The HTTP Fetch node provides response headers as an additional output that can be examined or passed to other nodes.

**Why this priority**: Nice to have for advanced scenarios, but not required for basic functionality. Many use cases only need the response body.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by fetching from an endpoint with known headers and verifying that the headers output contains the expected key-value pairs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a successful HTTP response, **When** the HTTP Fetch node completes, **Then** response headers are available as a structured output
2. **Given** headers containing standard fields (Content-Type, Content-Length), **When** the node executes, **Then** these headers are correctly parsed and accessible
3. **Given** headers containing custom application-specific fields, **When** the node executes, **Then** all headers are preserved and accessible

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a URL redirects to another domain that is not in the approved capability list? (Answer: The redirect is blocked and an error is returned)
- What happens when a URL redirects within the same approved domain? (Answer: The redirect is followed automatically)
- How does the system handle extremely large responses (multi-megabyte payloads)? Is there a size limit to prevent memory exhaustion?
- What happens if a request exceeds the default 30-second timeout? (Answer: An error is returned indicating timeout)
- How does the component handle different character encodings in response bodies (UTF-8, Latin-1, etc.)?
- What happens when the network connection is lost mid-request?
- How does the component handle URLs with special characters or requiring encoding?
- What happens when a user provides a custom timeout value that is invalid (negative, zero, or extremely large)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST perform real HTTP GET requests to external URLs using actual network connectivity
- **FR-002**: System MUST support both HTTP and HTTPS protocols with proper secure connection handling
- **FR-003**: System MUST return the complete response body as a string output
- **FR-004**: System MUST return the HTTP status code as a numeric output
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate that requested URLs are within the scope of approved network capabilities before making requests
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide clear error messages for network failures (DNS errors, connection timeouts, connection refused, etc.)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide clear error messages for HTTP errors (4xx client errors, 5xx server errors)
- **FR-008**: System MUST handle malformed or invalid URLs gracefully without crashing
- **FR-009**: System MUST declare required network capabilities in component metadata before execution
- **FR-010**: System MUST block network access until user explicitly grants capability approval
- **FR-011**: System MUST log HTTP request initiation and completion for debugging and audit purposes
- **FR-012**: System MUST enforce request timeouts to prevent indefinite blocking, using a smart default timeout (30 seconds) with an optional input parameter to override when users need different timeout behavior
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle HTTP redirects by automatically following redirects within approved network capability domains, while blocking and reporting cross-domain redirects that would access unapproved domains
- **FR-014**: System MUST handle response body encoding to ensure text content is correctly decoded to strings

### Key Entities

- **HTTP Request**: Represents an outbound network request with a target URL, optional headers, and method (GET only for this feature)
- **HTTP Response**: Contains status code, headers, and body text returned from the remote server
- **Network Capability**: Represents permission to access specific network domains/hosts, subject to user approval
- **Execution Context**: The runtime environment where the component executes, managing capability checks and network access

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can successfully fetch data from any public HTTP/HTTPS endpoint within approved capability scope
- **SC-002**: HTTP GET requests complete within a reasonable time for typical online endpoints (under 5 seconds for endpoints with latency < 1s, accounting for network variability)
- **SC-003**: Network errors (DNS failures, connection refused, timeouts) produce clear error messages that users can understand without technical expertise
- **SC-004**: 100% of HTTP responses include both the status code and body content in the node outputs
- **SC-005**: Users receive capability approval prompts before any network access occurs, ensuring informed consent
- **SC-006**: HTTP Fetch nodes can be composed with other nodes in graphs to build data processing pipelines (e.g., fetch → parse JSON → transform → output)

## Assumptions

- **Assumption 1**: The component runtime environment supports the necessary capabilities for making HTTP requests
- **Assumption 2**: Only HTTP GET requests are needed for this iteration; POST, PUT, DELETE, and other methods are out of scope
- **Assumption 3**: Request headers customization (custom headers, user-agent, etc.) is not required for the initial implementation
- **Assumption 4**: Response body size is expected to be reasonable (< 10MB) for typical API responses; handling of streaming large files is out of scope
- **Assumption 5**: Basic authentication (username/password in URL) is out of scope; OAuth and other authentication schemes are out of scope
- **Assumption 6**: Binary response data (images, PDFs, etc.) is out of scope; only text-based responses (JSON, XML, HTML, plain text) are targeted
- **Assumption 7**: The capability approval mechanism already exists in the WasmFlow host application or will be built as part of the core platform
- **Assumption 8**: Connection pooling, HTTP/2, and other performance optimizations are not required for the initial implementation

## Constraints

- **Security**: All network access must be mediated through the capability system - no unrestricted network access
- **Compatibility**: The component must integrate with the existing WasmFlow node interface
- **User Experience**: Network requests must not freeze or block the application interface during execution

## Out of Scope

- HTTP methods other than GET (POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, etc.)
- Custom request headers or header manipulation
- Request body payloads
- Authentication mechanisms (Basic Auth, OAuth, API keys, etc.)
- Cookie handling and session management
- HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 protocol features
- WebSocket connections
- Response streaming for large files
- Binary response data handling (images, files)
- Request/response interceptors or middleware
- Caching mechanisms
- Proxy configuration
- Certificate pinning or custom certificate validation
