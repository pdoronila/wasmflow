# Specification Quality Checklist: WASM Component Creator Node

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-18
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Status**: âœ… PASSED

All clarifications have been resolved:

1. **Port Specification Method** (Resolved): Users will specify input/output ports using structured code comments (format: `// @input name:type description` and `// @output name:type description`)
   - Added FR-019 and FR-020 to cover port parsing requirements
   - Updated US4-AS3 with concrete implementation approach

2. **Code Persistence** (Resolved): Hybrid approach - component name always saved, code optionally saved via user-controllable checkbox
   - Updated FR-018 to reflect hybrid persistence model
   - Added US3-AS4 and US3-AS5 to test both save states
   - Added assumptions about default checkbox state and user expectations

**Next Step**: Ready to proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning
