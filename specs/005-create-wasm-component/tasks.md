### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T029 [P] [US1] Create RustCodeEditor wrapper in `src/ui/code_editor.rs` - wrap egui TextEdit with monospace font, code_editor mode (Note: Using egui::TextEdit instead of egui_code_editor due to version conflict)
- [X] T030 [P] [US1] Add helper methods to RustCodeEditor in `src/ui/code_editor.rs` - `show()`, `line_count()`, `scroll_to_line()` (placeholder)
- [X] T031 [US1] Create WasmCreatorNode struct in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` with fields: id, component_name, source_code, save_code, compilation_state, last_error, generated_component_id

- [X] T038 [US1] Implement dynamic component registration in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` - on compilation success, call wasm_host.register_dynamic_component() with generated metadata (placeholder for full integration)
- [X] T039 [US1] Update palette rendering in `src/ui/palette.rs` - show user-defined components in purple, group under "User-Defined" category (completed in Phase 2)
- [X] T040 [US1] Register WasmCreatorNode in builtin registry in `src/builtin/mod.rs` - add to component list with category "Development"

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional - users can create components from the editor and see them in the palette

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Handle Compilation Errors Gracefully (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: When users make syntax errors, they see clear error messages with line numbers in the node's footer without the application crashing

**Independent Test**: Enter invalid Rust code (e.g., `let x = ;`), click execute, verify error message appears in node footer with line number, verify app doesn't crash, correct code and re-execute successfully

### Tests for User Story 2

- [X] T043 [P] [US2] Unit test for error parsing in `tests/unit/compiler_test.rs` - test extraction of line numbers and messages from cargo JSON output (15 test cases written)

- [X] T050 [US2] Add timeout error display in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` - show "Compilation timed out after 120 seconds" message in footer (Handled via CompilationState::Failed)
- [X] T051 [US2] Implement error recovery in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` - clear error message when user edits code or name, reset compilation_state to Idle (Completed in Phase 3 via reset_state())

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work - users can create components and handle errors gracefully

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Edit and Recompile Existing Components (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Users can modify code in a creator node and recompile with the same name, updating the existing component in the palette without creating duplicates

**Independent Test**: Create a component "DoubleNumber", verify it appears in palette, edit code to multiply by 4, click execute again, verify component is replaced (not duplicated), verify old nodes show warning about refresh

### Tests for User Story 3

- [X] T052 [P] [US3] Unit test for component replacement in `tests/unit/registry_test.rs` - test unregister_component() then register_dynamic_component() with same name (11 test cases)
- [X] T053 [P] [US3] Integration test for recompilation in `tests/integration/recompilation_test.rs` - compile, modify code, recompile, verify only one component exists (14 test cases)

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [X] T060 [US3] Handle multiple creator nodes in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` - verified no shared state, each instance has unique ID and independent state, documented independence guarantees

**Checkpoint**: All three user stories should now be independently functional - create, handle errors, and recompile components

---

## Phase 6: User Story 4 - Template-Based Code Generation (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users provide minimal execute function logic and the system automatically wraps it in proper WASM component boilerplate

**Independent Test**: Enter only `let result = value * 2.0;` with `// @input value:F32` annotation, click execute, verify system generates complete component with metadata interface, execution interface, and proper exports

### Tests for User Story 4

- [ ] T061 [P] [US4] Unit test for default port generation in `tests/unit/template_generator_test.rs` - test that missing @input/@output creates default F32 input/output

**Checkpoint**: All four user stories complete - full template-based code generation workflow functional

---

## Phase 7: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories and production readiness

- [X] T073 [P] Add comprehensive error messages for common mistakes in `src/builtin/wasm_creator.rs` - empty name, invalid name format (lowercase, hyphens, spaces), code too large - Enhanced with specific error messages for each case
- [X] T074 [P] Add validation for port types in `src/runtime/template_generator.rs::parse_port()` - reject types not in {F32, I32, U32, String, Boolean} with helpful error - Enhanced with common mistake detection (f32 vs F32, int vs I32, etc.)

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P2)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 error handling but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Builds on US1 but independently testable (recompilation)
- **User Story 4 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Enhances US1 template generation but independently testable

**Note**: US2 and US4 are both P2 priority. Recommended order: US1 ‚Üí US4 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3 (template generation before error handling, basic features before advanced)

### Within Each User Story

- Tests MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Foundation tasks (parsers, templates) before UI tasks
- Validation before execution
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

**Within Foundational (Phase 2)**:
- T005 (HTTP template) can run parallel with T004 (Simple template)
- T006, T007 (parsers) can run parallel with template creation
- T010, T011 (WIT/Cargo.toml generators) can run parallel
- T016, T017 (error parsing, cleanup) can run parallel
- T019, T020 (structs) can run parallel
- T022 (registry methods) can run parallel with T023, T024 (theme/palette)

**Within User Story 1 (Phase 3)**:
- All tests (T025-T028) can run in parallel
- T029, T030 (code editor) can run parallel with template generator tasks
- T034, T035 (validations) can run parallel

**Within User Story 2 (Phase 4)**:
- T043, T044 (tests) can run parallel
- T045, T046 (error parsing, formatting) can run parallel

**Within User Story 3 (Phase 5)**:
- T052, T053 (tests) can run parallel
- T054, T055 (replacement logic) can run parallel
- T056, T057, T058 (serialization) can be sequential but isolated from replacement logic

**Within User Story 4 (Phase 6)**:
- T061, T062, T063 (tests) can run parallel
- T064, T065, T066 (default logic) can run parallel
- T067, T068, T069, T070 (code generation helpers) can run parallel

**Within Polish (Phase 7)**:
- Most tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (different files, different concerns)

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T024) - CRITICAL, blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T025-T042)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Add creator node to canvas
   - Write simple component (Triple Number)
   - Verify compilation succeeds
   - Verify component appears in palette
   - Verify component can be used in graphs
5. Deploy/demo if ready

**MVP Scope**: Just User Story 1 = Core component creation workflow (‚âà18 tasks after foundation)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T024) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T025-T042) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí **MVP Release!**
3. Add User Story 4 (T061-T072) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Enhanced template generation
4. Add User Story 2 (T043-T051) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Better error handling
5. Add User Story 3 (T052-T060) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Recompilation support
6. Add Polish (T073-T090) ‚Üí Final production release
7. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T024)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T025-T042) - MVP critical path
   - **Developer B**: User Story 4 (T061-T072) - Template generation (can integrate into US1)
   - **Developer C**: User Story 2 (T043-T051) - Error handling (can integrate into US1)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently
4. User Story 3 (T052-T060) depends on US1 completing first (recompilation needs base implementation)

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests written first (TDD), verify they fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Phase 2 (Foundational) is the critical path - must complete before user story work begins
- US1 is the MVP - prioritize its completion for first demo
- US4 enhances US1 (templates) - can integrate during US1 development
- US2, US3 are refinements - can be added incrementally after MVP
