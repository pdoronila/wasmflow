# Specification Quality Checklist: Component Directory Reorganization

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items satisfied

**Details**:
- Content Quality: All sections focus on "what" and "why" without implementation details
- Requirements: All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
- Success Criteria: All 6 criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "Application successfully loads all components" rather than "Code in app.rs successfully reads bin/ directory")
- Completeness: No clarification markers, all edge cases identified, clear scope boundaries
- User Scenarios: 3 prioritized, independently testable user stories with clear acceptance criteria

**Ready for Planning**: Yes - This specification is ready for `/speckit.plan`

## Notes

- Spec is well-scoped for a simple directory reorganization task
- All requirements map cleanly to the user stories
- Success criteria are verifiable without knowledge of Rust implementation
- Edge cases appropriately identify boundary conditions (empty directory, missing directory, duplicate files)
