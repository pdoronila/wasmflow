# Specification Quality Checklist: JSON Parser Node

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: âœ… PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Validation Details**:

1. **Content Quality**: PASSED
   - Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific libraries, only "WASM-compatible JSON parsing library" as a dependency)
   - Focus is on what users need (extracting values from JSON) and why
   - Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders
   - All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are present and complete

2. **Requirement Completeness**: PASSED
   - No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all assumptions documented in Assumptions section
   - All 15 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous
   - Success criteria use measurable metrics (time, size, percentage, depth)
   - Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
   - All 4 user stories have detailed acceptance scenarios
   - 10 edge cases explicitly identified
   - Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section
   - Dependencies and assumptions clearly documented

3. **Feature Readiness**: PASSED
   - All functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
   - User scenarios cover all priority levels (P1-P3) and build incrementally
   - Success criteria align with user scenarios and requirements
   - No implementation details in the specification

## Notes

- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All reasonable defaults were chosen and documented in Assumptions section
- No clarifications needed from user
