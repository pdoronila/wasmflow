# Specification Quality Checklist: WebAssembly Node-Based Visual Programming System

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **No implementation details**: Specification describes WHAT and WHY without mentioning specific technologies, frameworks, or code structure. Success criteria focus on user-facing metrics (e.g., "Users can create a functional 5-node graph within 2 minutes") rather than technical implementation.

✅ **User value focused**: All user stories clearly articulate user goals and value delivered. Priority justifications explain business/user impact.

✅ **Accessible to non-technical stakeholders**: Language is clear and jargon-free. Technical concepts (WebAssembly, nodes, ports) are explained in functional terms.

✅ **Mandatory sections complete**: User Scenarios, Requirements (Functional + Key Entities), and Success Criteria sections are all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **No clarification markers**: Specification makes informed decisions based on industry standards for visual programming tools. All ambiguities resolved through reasonable defaults documented in Assumptions section.

✅ **Testable requirements**: All 20 functional requirements use verifiable language ("MUST provide", "MUST enforce", "MUST display"). Each can be validated through observable behavior.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All 10 criteria include specific metrics:
- Time-based: SC-001 (2 minutes), SC-003 (3 seconds), SC-004 (500ms)
- Performance: SC-002 (60 FPS), SC-008 (500MB memory)
- Quality: SC-005, SC-006, SC-010 (100% of cases)
- User success: SC-007 (90% completion rate)
- Reliability: SC-009 (zero data loss)

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: No mention of implementation technologies in success criteria. Focus on user-observable outcomes and system behavior.

✅ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: Each of 4 user stories includes 4 detailed Given-When-Then scenarios (16 total). Cover happy paths and error cases.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 7 edge cases documented covering error handling, resource limits, versioning, and concurrency.

✅ **Clear scope**: Explicit non-goals in assumptions (no collaboration, no marketplace, offline-first). User stories prioritized to enable incremental delivery.

✅ **Dependencies documented**: Assumptions section lists 7 dependencies including platform, user skills, trust model, and resource availability.

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Requirements have acceptance criteria**: All 20 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories. Each requirement is validated by at least one Given-When-Then scenario.

✅ **User scenarios cover flows**: 4 user stories progress from basic (P1: create/execute) to advanced (P4: permissions). Each story is independently testable and delivers incremental value.

✅ **Measurable outcomes defined**: 10 success criteria cover all critical dimensions: usability (SC-001, SC-007), performance (SC-002, SC-003, SC-004, SC-008), reliability (SC-005, SC-006, SC-009, SC-010).

✅ **No implementation leakage**: Specification avoids prescribing HOW to implement. For example, doesn't specify UI framework, execution engine architecture, or data serialization format—these are deferred to planning phase.

## Notes

All checklist items passed successfully. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization enabling MVP-first delivery (P1 story is independently valuable)
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Strong security requirements (permission system in FR-013, FR-014, SC-010)
- Quantified performance targets aligned with desktop application expectations
- Well-scoped with explicit assumptions to guide planning

No action items required before proceeding to next phase.
