# Feature Specification: WebAssembly Node-Based Visual Programming System

**Feature Branch**: `001-webassembly-based-node`
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "WebAssembly-based node editor with visual programming capabilities"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Create and Execute Simple Data Flow (Priority: P1)

A user wants to build a simple data processing pipeline by visually connecting pre-built computational nodes, such as adding numbers or transforming text, and see the results immediately.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value propositionâ€”enabling users to compose functionality without writing code. All other features depend on this foundation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening the application, dragging two math operation nodes onto the canvas, connecting them, providing input values, and observing output. Delivers immediate value as a visual calculator.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the application is open, **When** the user drags an "Add" node onto the canvas, **Then** the node appears with visible input and output ports
2. **Given** two nodes are on the canvas, **When** the user drags from an output port to an input port, **Then** a connection line appears and the connection is established
3. **Given** a connected graph with constant value nodes feeding an "Add" node, **When** the user triggers execution, **Then** the result appears on the output port within 1 second
4. **Given** a node connection with incompatible types, **When** the user attempts to connect them, **Then** the system prevents the connection and displays a clear error message explaining the type mismatch

---

### User Story 2 - Save and Load Processing Pipelines (Priority: P2)

A user wants to save their composed node graph to disk and reload it later, preserving all node positions, connections, and configuration values.

**Why this priority**: Without persistence, users lose work between sessions. This is essential for practical use but secondary to creating graphs in the first place.

**Independent Test**: Create a simple 3-node graph, save to a file, close the application, reopen it, load the file, and verify all nodes, connections, and values are restored exactly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a node graph is displayed, **When** the user selects "Save Graph" and chooses a file location, **Then** the graph is saved to disk and a success message is shown
2. **Given** a saved graph file exists, **When** the user selects "Load Graph" and chooses the file, **Then** all nodes appear in their saved positions with all connections and values intact
3. **Given** an unsaved graph with changes, **When** the user attempts to close the application, **Then** a dialog prompts to save changes before exiting
4. **Given** a corrupted or incompatible graph file, **When** the user attempts to load it, **Then** an error message explains the issue and the application remains stable

---

### User Story 3 - Use Custom Extension Nodes (Priority: P3)

A user wants to extend the system's capabilities by loading custom-built computational nodes from external files, allowing specialized processing beyond the built-in nodes.

**Why this priority**: Extensibility is a key differentiator but requires the foundation of graph creation and persistence to be valuable. Users need to create graphs before they need custom nodes.

**Independent Test**: Provide a pre-built custom node file (e.g., a text transformation component), load it into the application via a menu option, add it to a graph, connect it, and verify it executes correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid custom node file exists on disk, **When** the user selects "Load Component" and chooses the file, **Then** the new node type appears in the node palette
2. **Given** a custom node is loaded, **When** the user adds it to the graph and connects it, **Then** it behaves identically to built-in nodes (visual appearance, execution, type checking)
3. **Given** a custom node requests system access permissions, **When** the user first adds it to a graph, **Then** a permission dialog clearly lists requested capabilities and allows approval or denial
4. **Given** a custom node file is malformed or incompatible, **When** the user attempts to load it, **Then** an error message explains the specific problem and the system remains stable

---

### User Story 4 - Manage Node Permissions for Safe Execution (Priority: P4)

A user wants to review and control what system resources (files, network) each custom node can access, ensuring untrusted nodes cannot compromise their system.

**Why this priority**: Security is critical for user trust when running third-party code, but it's only relevant after custom nodes are supported (User Story 3).

**Independent Test**: Load a custom node that requests file system access, review the permission dialog, grant limited access to a specific folder, execute the node, and verify it can only access the approved location.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a custom node declares file read permissions, **When** the node is added to a graph, **Then** a permission dialog lists the specific directories requested
2. **Given** a user grants file access to a specific folder, **When** the node executes, **Then** it can read files only from the approved directory and subdirectories
3. **Given** a node attempts to access a denied resource, **When** execution occurs, **Then** the operation fails gracefully with a clear permission error message
4. **Given** previously granted permissions, **When** a user views node properties, **Then** current permissions are displayed and can be revoked or modified

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a node graph contains a cycle (circular dependency)?
- How does the system handle a node that takes longer than 10 seconds to execute?
- What occurs when a user attempts to connect 100+ nodes in a single graph?
- How does the system respond when a custom node crashes or throws an unhandled error during execution?
- What happens when a user loads a graph file created in a newer version of the application?
- How does the system behave when disk space is exhausted during a save operation?
- What occurs if two nodes both request write access to the same file?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Key Entities

- **Node**: A computational unit with defined inputs, outputs, internal processing logic, and visual representation. Has a unique identifier, display name, position on canvas, and metadata (author, version, description).

- **Port**: An input or output connection point on a node. Has a name, data type constraint, and optionality flag. Inputs receive data from connections; outputs provide data.

- **Connection**: A directed link from one node's output port to another node's input port. Enforces type compatibility and represents data flow direction.

- **Graph**: A collection of nodes and connections forming a processing pipeline. Contains layout information, execution state, and metadata. Serializable to/from disk.

- **Component**: A specification defining node behavior, including interface (inputs/outputs), implementation logic, and required system capabilities. Can be built-in (compiled into application) or custom (loaded from external files).

- **Capability Grant**: A user-approved permission allowing a node to access specific system resources (file paths, network hosts, memory limits). Scoped to minimize exposure.

- **Node Value**: Data flowing through connections. Typed (integer, float, string, binary, list, record) and serializable.

### Assumptions

- Users have basic computer literacy (can use menus, drag-and-drop, file dialogs)
- The target platform is desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Custom nodes are provided by trusted sources or vetted by users (marketplace/curation is out of scope)
- Network connectivity is not required for core functionality (offline-first)
- Graphs are created and executed by a single user (no real-time collaboration)
- Custom node file format follows a defined specification (to be determined during planning)
- System resources (CPU, RAM) are sufficient for desktop application development tools
