# Tasks: WebAssembly Node-Based Visual Programming System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-webassembly-based-node/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), data-model.md, contracts/node-interface.wit

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions
- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- Paths reference plan.md structure (src/ui/, src/runtime/, src/graph/, src/builtin/)

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure needed by all user stories

- [x] T009 [P] Define ComponentSpec struct in src/graph/node.rs: id, name, description, author, version, component_type (Builtin/UserDefined enum), input_spec, output_spec, required_capabilities
- [x] T010 [P] Define CapabilitySet enum in src/runtime/capabilities.rs: None, FileRead, FileWrite, FileReadWrite, Network, Full variants with path/host restrictions
- [x] T011 Define NodeGraph struct in src/graph/graph.rs: id, name, nodes HashMap, connections Vec, metadata, version, execution_order_cache
- [x] T012 Copy WIT interface from specs/001-webassembly-based-node/contracts/node-interface.wit to wit/node.wit at repository root
- [x] T013 Create error types in src/lib.rs: GraphError (CycleDetected, TypeMismatch, InvalidConnection), ComponentError (LoadFailed, ValidationFailed, ExecutionError, PermissionDenied), SerializationError using thiserror

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational completion - No dependencies on other stories (can run in parallel with US1)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational completion - Builds on US1 (needs working graph creation/execution)
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational + US3 completion (needs component loading to demonstrate permissions)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Independent of US1 (serialization is self-contained)
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Requires US1 complete (needs working graph execution to demonstrate custom components)
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Requires US3 complete (permissions only relevant for custom components)

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Type checking (T014-T015) ‚Üí Graph operations (T016-T017) ‚Üí Builtin nodes (T018-T022) ‚Üí Registry (T023) ‚Üí Execution (T024-T027) ‚Üí UI (T028-T039)
- **US2**: Serialization (T040-T043) ‚Üí UI integration (T044-T050)

- **US4**: Capability infrastructure (T066-T071) ‚Üí Permission UI (T072-T081)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T005-T006 sequential, then T008-T010 can run in parallel
- **US1**: T014-T015 parallel, T018-T022 parallel (all builtin nodes), T030-T032 parallel (UI components)
- **US2**: T040-T041 sequential, T044-T045 sequential, T049-T050 parallel
- **US3**: T051-T054 parallel (host setup), T063-T065 parallel (UI polish)
- **US4**: T066-T070 parallel (capability variants), T072-T073 parallel (UI), T078-T081 parallel (advanced features)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: T082-T092 all parallel, T099-T100 parallel

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T004)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T005-T013) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T039)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Open app ‚Üí Add nodes ‚Üí Connect ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí See results
   - Verify 60 FPS rendering, type checking, error messages
5. Deploy/demo if ready (visual calculator MVP is valuable on its own)

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational (T001-T013) ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 (T014-T039) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
   - **Value delivered**: Visual programming calculator, immediate utility
3. Add User Story 2 (T040-T050) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - **Value delivered**: Persistence, users can save/share graphs
4. Add User Story 3 (T051-T065) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - **Value delivered**: Extensibility, users can create custom nodes
5. Add User Story 4 (T066-T081) ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
   - **Value delivered**: Security, safe execution of untrusted components
6. Add Polish (T082-T100) ‚Üí Final release
   - **Value delivered**: Performance, UX polish, documentation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T013)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - **Developer A**: User Story 1 (T014-T039) - Core graph execution
   - **Developer B**: User Story 2 (T040-T050) - Serialization (can start immediately, independent)
   - **Developer C**: Prepare User Story 3 infrastructure (research wasmtime, test examples)
3. Once US1 complete, Developer C starts US3 (T051-T065)
4. Once US3 complete, Developer A or B starts US4 (T066-T081)
5. Polish phase: All developers work on T082-T100 in parallel

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, can run concurrently
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Each user story is independently completable and testable
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Commit after each task or logical group (e.g., all builtin nodes)
- Tests not included per spec (no explicit test request in spec.md)
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

## Critical Success Metrics (from spec.md)
