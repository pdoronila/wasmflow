# Tasks: Continuous Execution Nodes

**Feature**: 006-continuous-node-can
**Branch**: `006-continuous-node-can`
**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/006-continuous-node-can/`

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`
- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Add dependencies and basic type definitions needed by all user stories

- [x] T001 Add `tokio-util = "0.7"` dependency to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/Cargo.toml` for CancellationToken support
- [x] T002 [P] Add continuous execution error types to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/lib.rs` (ContinuousNodeError enum with variants: ExecutionFailed, PermissionDenied, Timeout, NetworkError, ComponentTrap)
- [x] T003 [P] Configure clippy to allow new async patterns in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/.cargo/config.toml` (if needed)

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core data structures and state management that ALL user stories depend on

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T004 Add `ContinuousNodeConfig` struct to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/node.rs` with fields: supports_continuous (bool), enabled (bool), runtime_state (with #[serde(skip)])
- [x] T005 Add `ContinuousExecutionState` enum to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/node.rs` with variants: Idle, Starting, Running, Stopping, Stopped, Error
- [x] T006 Add `ContinuousRuntimeState` struct to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/node.rs` with fields: is_running (bool), started_at (Option<Instant>), iterations (u64), last_error (Option<String>), task_handle (Option<JoinHandle>)
- [x] T007 Add `continuous_config: Option<ContinuousNodeConfig>` field to `GraphNode` struct in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/node.rs`
- [x] T008 Update graph serialization in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/serialization.rs` to clear runtime_state before saving (lines ~99-108)
- [x] T009 Update graph deserialization in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/serialization.rs` to ensure all continuous nodes start with runtime_state defaulted to stopped
- [x] T010 Create `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` with `ContinuousExecutionManager` struct skeleton (empty implementation for now)
- [x] T011 [P] Create `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/state.rs` with state transition validation functions (validate_transition, can_start, can_stop)
- [x] T012 [P] Add `ControlMessage` enum to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` with variants: Start{node_id}, Stop{node_id}, Shutdown
- [x] T013 [P] Add `ExecutionResult` enum to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` with variants: Started, Stopped{iterations, duration}, OutputsUpdated{node_id, outputs}, Error{node_id, error}, IterationComplete

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - all core types defined, serialization handles continuous nodes

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Start Long-Running Service Node (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Users can click play to start a continuous node that runs indefinitely, and click stop to gracefully shut it down

**Independent Test**: Create a simple continuous node (timer that increments a counter), click play, verify it shows "Running" state and counter increments continuously, click stop, verify it returns to "Idle" state within 2 seconds

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [X] T015 [P] [US1] Create `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/async_runtime.rs` with helper function to spawn tokio runtime in background thread (integrated into execution_loop)
- [X] T016 [US1] Implement `ContinuousExecutionManager::start_node()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - send ControlMessage::Start, spawn async task with cancellation token
- [X] T017 [US1] Implement `ContinuousExecutionManager::stop_node()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - send ControlMessage::Stop, implement 3-phase shutdown (1.5s graceful + 0.5s forced abort)
- [X] T018 [US1] Implement `ContinuousExecutionManager::poll_results()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - non-blocking `try_recv()` to get ExecutionResults (result channel passed directly to UI)
- [X] T019 [US1] Implement continuous execution loop in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - check cancellation token, execute WASM component iteration, send results
- [X] T020 [US1] Add `continuous_manager: Option<ContinuousExecutionManager>` field to WasmFlowApp in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs`
- [X] T021 [US1] Initialize `ContinuousExecutionManager` in `WasmFlowApp::new()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs`
- [X] T022 [US1] Add play button rendering to node UI in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/canvas.rs` (show play if node.continuous_config.enabled == true && state == Idle)
- [X] T023 [US1] Add stop button rendering to node UI in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/canvas.rs` (show stop if state == Running)
- [X] T024 [US1] Handle play button click in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - call continuous_manager.start_node(node_id), update node state to Starting
- [X] T025 [US1] Handle stop button click in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - call continuous_manager.stop_node(node_id), update node state to Stopping
- [X] T026 [US1] Add `poll_continuous_results()` to `WasmFlowApp::update()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - call every frame, update node states based on ExecutionResults
- [X] T027 [US1] Add `ctx.request_repaint()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` when any continuous nodes are running
- [X] T028 [US1] Create example builtin continuous node (simple timer) in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/builtin/continuous_example.rs` - increments counter every 100ms
- [X] T029 [US1] Register example continuous node in builtin registry in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs`
- [X] T030 [US1] Implement graceful shutdown in `WasmFlowApp::drop()` in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - stop all running continuous nodes before app exits

**Checkpoint**: At this point, users can start/stop continuous nodes with play/stop buttons. Basic lifecycle works.

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - Monitor Running Nodes (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: Users can visually distinguish running vs stopped vs error states for continuous nodes at a glance

**Independent Test**: Start multiple continuous nodes, verify each shows distinct visual indicators (green pulsing for running, gray for idle, red for error). Stop some nodes, verify visual state updates within 1 second.

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [X] T031 [P] [US2] Create `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/execution_status.rs` with function to get color for execution state (Idle‚Üígray, Starting‚Üíyellow, Running‚Üígreen, Stopping‚Üíorange, Stopped‚Üígray, Error‚Üíred)
- [X] T032 [P] [US2] Add pulsing animation helper to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/execution_status.rs` for running state indicator
- [X] T033 [US2] Apply execution state colors to node rendering in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/canvas.rs` - set stroke color based on continuous_config.runtime_state.execution_state

- [X] T036 [US2] Add error icon/indicator to failed nodes in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/canvas.rs` - show when state == Error
- [X] T037 [US2] Add tooltip on hover showing execution state details in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/canvas.rs` (started_at, iterations, last_error if present)
- [X] T038 [US2] Add error display to status bar in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - show continuous_error with red colored label (similar to existing error_message pattern at lines ~1045-1050)
- [X] T039 [US2] Implement error state handling in continuous execution manager - when component fails, send ExecutionResult::Error and update node state to Error
- [X] T040 [US2] Add panic catching in continuous execution loop in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - use `catch_unwind` to capture panics and convert to ComponentTrap errors
- [X] T041 [US2] Implement error reset functionality in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - clicking play on error state node clears error and restarts

**Checkpoint**: At this point, users can easily see which nodes are running, stopped, or errored. Visual feedback is clear and immediate.

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - Continuous Input Processing (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: Continuous nodes automatically detect and process new input values as they arrive from connected nodes

**Independent Test**: Create a continuous node connected to an input source (e.g., text input), start the continuous node, change input value, verify continuous node processes new input within 100ms and updates its output

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [~] T042 [P] [US3] Add input change detection to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **PARTIAL**: Implemented for timer's interval input (lines 243, 255-262), general solution deferred (see notes below)
- [X] T043 [P] [US3] Add input hash calculation to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/graph/node.rs` - helper function `compute_input_hash()` implemented (lines 431-504)
- [~] T044 [US3] Modify continuous execution loop in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **PARTIAL**: Fetches interval from graph each iteration (line 252), general input fetching deferred
- [~] T045 [US3] Add input value caching to prevent redundant processing in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **PARTIAL**: Interval caching implemented (line 243), general caching deferred
- [ ] T046 [US3] Implement input update notifications via channels in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **DEFERRED**: Requires architectural changes (push-based notifications vs current poll-based)
- [ ] T047 [US3] Trigger input update notifications when node outputs change in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/ui/app.rs` - **DEFERRED**: Depends on T046
- [ ] T048 [US3] Add queue for input changes in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **DEFERRED**: Requires notification system (T046-T047) first
- [ ] T049 [US3] Implement input processing order guarantee in continuous execution loop - **DEFERRED**: Requires queue system (T048) first
- [X] T050 [US3] Add test continuous node with multiple inputs in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/builtin/continuous_example.rs` - `ContinuousCombinerExecutor` created with 3 inputs (input_a, input_b, separator)
- [~] T051 [US3] Add input change logging to `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/src/runtime/continuous.rs` - **PARTIAL**: Interval change logging implemented (lines 255-262), general logging deferred

**Checkpoint**: At this point, continuous nodes react to input changes automatically. All user stories are independently functional.

**Phase 5 Implementation Notes**:
- **Current State**: Basic reactive input processing is demonstrated for the timer node (interval input). The infrastructure exists (hash function, combiner example node) but full general-purpose reactive processing requires architectural changes.
- **What Works**: Timer node reacts to interval changes, ContinuousCombinerExecutor demonstrates multi-input continuous execution, input hash calculation is available for change detection.
- **What's Deferred**: Push-based input notifications (T046-T049) would require refactoring the continuous execution loop to be fully generic and node-agnostic, rather than timer-specific. This is an enhancement for future iterations.
- **Testing Approach**: The combiner node can be tested manually by connecting its inputs to other nodes and observing output changes, but automatic input change detection across iterations is not yet implemented for generic continuous nodes.

---

## Phase 6: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements, validation, and cleanup across all user stories

- [~] T053 [P] Add continuous execution lifecycle tests in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/tests/integration/continuous_lifecycle_test.rs` - **PARTIAL**: Test file created with 5 lifecycle tests, needs signature fixes for compilation
- [ ] T054 [P] Add UI responsiveness tests in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/tests/integration/async_ui.rs` - verify UI stays at 60fps with 10 concurrent continuous nodes - **DEFERRED** (requires benchmarking framework)

- [ ] T057 [P] Add resource cleanup verification test - ensure no memory leaks after 100 start/stop cycles - **DEFERRED** (requires memory profiling tools)
- [ ] T058 [P] Add timeout enforcement test - verify forced termination occurs if graceful shutdown exceeds 2 seconds - **DEFERRED** (covered by T053 lifecycle tests)
- [ ] T059 [P] Update quickstart.md validation - build example continuous node from guide and verify it works - **NOT APPLICABLE** (no quickstart guide exists for continuous nodes yet)

- [ ] T061 Security audit for capability enforcement - verify continuous nodes re-validate capabilities on start - **DEFERRED** (capability system not yet implemented)
- [X] T062 [P] Add logging for all continuous execution events (start, stop, error, iteration milestones) - Added comprehensive logging in `src/runtime/continuous.rs` (lines 152, 173, 256, 347, 371, 406)
- [ ] T063 [P] Add metrics/telemetry for continuous node statistics (total running time, iteration count, error rate) - **DEFERRED** (basic metrics tracked in runtime_state, telemetry system not implemented)
- [X] T064 Code cleanup - remove debug prints, add documentation comments to public APIs - Removed unused `pulsing_stroke_width` function from `src/ui/execution_status.rs`
- [X] T065 [P] Update CLAUDE.md with continuous execution patterns and best practices - Added "Continuous Execution Guidelines" section with 7 best practices
- [ ] T066 [P] Create example HTTP server node in `/Users/doronila/git/wasmflow_cc/examples/http-server/` demonstrating continuous execution with network capabilities - **DEFERRED** (HTTP server requires WASI HTTP component implementation)

- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-5)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories CAN proceed in parallel (if staffed) since they're mostly independent
  - Or sequentially in priority order (US1 ‚Üí US2 ‚Üí US3)
- **Polish (Phase 6)**: Depends on desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories

## Parallel Example: User Story 1 Core Implementation

```bash
# Launch foundational data structures together:
Task: "Add ContinuousNodeConfig to src/graph/node.rs"
Task: "Add ContinuousExecutionState enum to src/graph/node.rs"
Task: "Add ContinuousRuntimeState to src/graph/node.rs"

# Then launch manager components together:
Task: "Create src/runtime/continuous.rs with manager skeleton"
Task: "Create src/graph/state.rs with validation functions"
Task: "Add ControlMessage enum to continuous.rs"
Task: "Add ExecutionResult enum to continuous.rs"

# Then implement US1 in parallel streams:

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T003) - Add dependencies
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T004-T013) - Core types, CRITICAL blocker
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T014-T030) - Basic start/stop functionality
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Create continuous timer node, start it, verify it runs, stop it, verify it stops within 2s
5. Deploy/demo MVP if ready

**MVP Deliverable**: Users can create continuous nodes with play/stop controls. Basic lifecycle management works.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Foundation** (Phase 1-2): Dependencies + core types ‚Üí Ready for feature development
2. **MVP** (Phase 3): User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users can start/stop continuous nodes
3. **Enhanced UX** (Phase 4): User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Users get clear visual feedback
4. **Reactive Workflows** (Phase 5): User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Continuous nodes react to input changes
5. **Production Ready** (Phase 6): Polish ‚Üí Test suite, performance validation, examples

Each increment adds value without breaking previous functionality.

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. **All together**: Complete Setup + Foundational (Phase 1-2)
2. **Once Foundational is done (after T013)**:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T014-T030) - Core functionality
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T031-T041) - Visual indicators (depends on US1 API)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T042-T051) - Input processing (depends on US1 loop)
3. **Integration point**: Once all stories complete, test together
4. **Polish team**: Phase 6 tests and optimization

## Notes

- **[P] tasks** = different files or different functions, no dependencies, can run in parallel
- **[Story] label** maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3) for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are NOT included by default - only add if explicitly requested
- Commit after each task or logical group of parallel tasks
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently before proceeding
- Priority order: P1 (core functionality) must work before P2 (UX) or P3 (reactive)
