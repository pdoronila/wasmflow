# Feature Specification: Continuous Execution Nodes

**Feature Branch**: `006-continuous-node-can`
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "continuous-node Can we create a node that has a play button that continuously runs instead of only running once when the execute button is pressed. The idea is this node would be used to implement a web server, to listen to a socket or use a HTTP server. Or this continuous would process its input and execute its execute function continuously."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Start Long-Running Service Node (Priority: P1)

Users need to create nodes that run continuously (like web servers or event listeners) rather than executing once and stopping. They should be able to start these nodes with a dedicated control and have them run indefinitely until explicitly stopped.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables new use cases (servers, listeners, continuous processing) that are impossible with single-execution nodes. Without this, the feature cannot deliver any value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a continuous node, clicking the play button, and verifying it continues running and processing inputs without stopping. Delivers immediate value by enabling server-like functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a continuous node is created in the graph, **When** the user clicks the play button, **Then** the node begins continuous execution and shows a running state indicator
2. **Given** a continuous node is running, **When** it processes input, **Then** it continues executing without stopping after each execution cycle
3. **Given** a continuous node is running, **When** the user clicks the stop button, **Then** the node stops execution gracefully and returns to idle state
4. **Given** a continuous node is idle, **When** the user clicks the play button, **Then** the node resumes continuous execution from its current state

### User Story 2 - Monitor Running Nodes (Priority: P2)

Users need clear visual feedback about which nodes are running continuously vs. idle, so they can manage their graph's execution state effectively.

**Why this priority**: Without clear status indicators, users cannot tell which nodes are running, leading to confusion and potential resource issues. This is essential for usability but the nodes can technically function without it.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting multiple continuous nodes and verifying each shows distinct visual states (running, stopped, error). Delivers value by making node state transparent to users.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a continuous node is running, **When** the user views the graph, **Then** the node displays a clear visual indicator of its running state (distinct from idle nodes)
2. **Given** a continuous node encounters an error, **When** the error occurs, **Then** the node displays an error state and provides visibility into what failed
3. **Given** multiple continuous nodes are in the graph, **When** some are running and others stopped, **Then** users can visually distinguish between running and stopped nodes at a glance

### User Story 3 - Continuous Input Processing (Priority: P3)

Users need continuous nodes to automatically process new inputs as they arrive, enabling reactive workflows where data flows trigger processing without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: This enables advanced reactive patterns but basic continuous execution (P1) works without it. Users can still implement servers or listeners that poll for data.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting an input source to a continuous node and verifying it processes each new input automatically. Delivers value for event-driven architectures.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a continuous node is running and connected to input nodes, **When** input values change, **Then** the continuous node automatically processes the new inputs
2. **Given** a continuous node is processing inputs, **When** multiple inputs arrive in quick succession, **Then** the node processes them in order without dropping data
3. **Given** a continuous node is stopped, **When** inputs change, **Then** the node does not process them until restarted

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a continuous node is still running and the user attempts to execute the entire graph?
- How does the system handle a continuous node that crashes or throws an unhandled error during execution?
- What happens when a user attempts to delete or modify a node that is currently running continuously?
- How does the system behave when a continuous node has no inputs connected but is started?
- What happens when multiple continuous nodes are interconnected in a cycle?
- How does the system handle resource cleanup when a continuous node is stopped (open connections, allocated memory)?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a play/start control for nodes designated as continuous execution nodes
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide a stop control for continuous nodes that are currently running
- **FR-003**: Continuous nodes MUST execute their function repeatedly without stopping until explicitly stopped by the user
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow only one execution mode at a time per continuous node (cannot be both running continuously and triggered by graph execution)
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual state indicators showing whether a continuous node is running, stopped, or in an error state
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle errors in continuous nodes gracefully, stopping execution and displaying error information to the user
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to designate which nodes should support continuous execution vs. single execution
- **FR-008**: Continuous nodes MUST be able to process their inputs each execution cycle when running continuously
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent modification or deletion of nodes while they are in running state
- **FR-010**: System MUST clean up resources (connections, memory, threads) when a continuous node is stopped
- **FR-011**: System MUST persist the execution mode preference (continuous vs. single) when saving and loading graphs
- **FR-012**: System MUST allow continuous nodes to continue running when other non-continuous nodes are executed in the graph

### Key Entities

- **Continuous Node**: A node in the graph that can execute repeatedly without stopping, with controls to start and stop its execution, and visual state indicators
- **Execution State**: The current runtime status of a continuous node (idle, running, stopped, error), determining which operations are permitted
- **Execution Cycle**: A single iteration of a continuous node's function execution, after which the node immediately begins the next cycle if still running

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can start a continuous node that runs indefinitely with a single play button click, without requiring repeated manual triggering
- **SC-002**: Continuous nodes process new inputs within 100ms of input changes, enabling responsive server-like behavior
- **SC-003**: Users can visually distinguish between running and stopped continuous nodes within 1 second of viewing the graph
- **SC-004**: System successfully stops continuous nodes within 2 seconds of user clicking stop, properly cleaning up resources
- **SC-005**: 95% of continuous node errors are displayed to users with actionable information about what failed
- **SC-006**: Users can successfully create and run server-like functionality (HTTP listeners, socket servers) using continuous nodes, validated by successful request/response cycles
