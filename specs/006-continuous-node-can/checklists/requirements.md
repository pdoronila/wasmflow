# Specification Quality Checklist: Continuous Execution Nodes

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED
**Date**: 2025-10-20

### Content Quality Review

- ✓ Specification avoids implementation details (no mention of specific frameworks, languages, or technical architecture)
- ✓ Focused on user needs: starting/stopping nodes, monitoring state, processing inputs continuously
- ✓ Written in business language that non-technical stakeholders can understand
- ✓ All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria

### Requirement Completeness Review

- ✓ No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the spec
- ✓ Each functional requirement (FR-001 through FR-012) is specific and testable
- ✓ Success criteria use measurable metrics (100ms response, 2 seconds to stop, 95% error visibility)
- ✓ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no mention of specific tech stack)
- ✓ Each user story includes specific acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- ✓ Edge cases section identifies 6 boundary conditions and error scenarios
- ✓ Scope is bounded: focuses on continuous execution capability without expanding to unrelated features
- ✓ Assumptions are implicit but reasonable (e.g., graph editor exists, nodes have execution capabilities)

### Feature Readiness Review

- ✓ All 12 functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- ✓ User scenarios cover primary flows: starting nodes (P1), monitoring state (P2), processing inputs (P3)
- ✓ Success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) provide clear measurable outcomes
- ✓ No implementation leakage detected

## Notes

All checklist items passed on first validation. The specification is ready to proceed to `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

Key strengths:
- Clear prioritization of user stories (P1, P2, P3) with independent test descriptions
- Comprehensive edge case analysis covering error scenarios and resource management
- Well-defined success criteria with specific performance metrics
- Technology-agnostic language throughout
