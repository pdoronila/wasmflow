# Feature Specification: Rectangle Selection Tool for Node Composition

**Feature Branch**: `007-rectangle-selection-tool`
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "rectangle-selection-tool Implement a rectangle-selection-tool to select multiple nodes in order to compose them together using WAC (https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wac). Once all the nodes are composed, a new node representing the composed nodes including inputs and outs and in the footer a list of components included in this composed node."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Select Multiple Nodes with Rectangle (Priority: P1)

Users can click and drag on the canvas to draw a rectangle that selects all nodes within its bounds, providing a quick way to select multiple nodes simultaneously for composition.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundational interaction that enables all other composition features. Without multi-select, users cannot proceed to composition.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by clicking and dragging on the canvas over multiple nodes and verifying that all nodes within the rectangle bounds are visually indicated as selected.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a canvas with 5 nodes scattered across it, **When** user clicks at position (100, 100) and drags to (300, 300), **Then** all nodes whose centers fall within that rectangle are highlighted as selected
2. **Given** a canvas with nodes, **When** user clicks and drags but releases before forming a meaningful rectangle (< 5 pixels), **Then** no selection is made and existing selection is cleared
3. **Given** some nodes are already selected, **When** user clicks and drags a new rectangle selection without holding a modifier key, **Then** previous selection is cleared and only nodes within the new rectangle are selected

### User Story 2 - Compose Selected Nodes into New Node (Priority: P2)

Users can trigger composition of selected nodes to create a new composite node that represents the grouped functionality, showing aggregated inputs/outputs and component details.

**Why this priority**: This delivers the core value of the feature - turning multiple nodes into a reusable composite component. Depends on P1 for node selection.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by selecting multiple nodes (using P1 feature), triggering composition action (via button or menu), and verifying a new node appears with correct inputs, outputs, and footer information.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** 3 nodes are selected with selection tool, **When** user triggers the "Compose" action, **Then** a new composite node is created showing aggregated inputs from the leftmost nodes, aggregated outputs from the rightmost nodes, and a footer listing the 3 component names
2. **Given** selected nodes have internal connections, **When** composition is triggered, **Then** the new composite node only exposes inputs that are not connected internally and outputs that are not consumed internally
3. **Given** selected nodes include both WASM components and built-in nodes, **When** composition is triggered, **Then** composition succeeds and footer distinguishes between built-in and WASM components
4. **Given** less than 2 nodes are selected, **When** user attempts to trigger composition, **Then** user receives feedback that at least 2 nodes are required for composition

---

### User Story 3 - Visual Feedback During Selection (Priority: P1)

Users see real-time visual feedback while drawing the selection rectangle and when nodes are selected, making the interaction intuitive and predictable.

**Why this priority**: Critical for usability - users need to understand what will be selected before releasing the mouse. Without this, the feature is unusable.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by observing visual changes during click-drag action and after selection is complete, without requiring composition functionality.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user starts dragging on the canvas, **When** mouse is moved, **Then** a semi-transparent rectangle outline is drawn from the start point to current mouse position
2. **Given** nodes are within the active selection rectangle, **When** user is still dragging, **Then** nodes within bounds show preview highlighting distinct from final selection
3. **Given** rectangle selection is complete, **When** user releases mouse, **Then** selection rectangle disappears and selected nodes show persistent selection highlighting

---

### User Story 4 - Drill Into Composite Node (Priority: P2)

Users can drill into a composite node to view and inspect the internal composed nodes in a separate layer view, then exit back to the main canvas.

**Why this priority**: Critical for understanding and debugging composite nodes. Without this, users cannot see what's inside a composition they created. Equally important as composition itself.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a composite node, triggering drill-down action (double-click or button), verifying that a new view shows only the internal nodes, and confirming exit action returns to main canvas.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a composite node exists on the canvas, **When** user double-clicks the composite node (or triggers drill-down action), **Then** view transitions to show only the internal composed nodes with their connections
2. **Given** user is in drill-down view of a composite node, **When** user looks for external nodes or other main canvas elements, **Then** only the composed nodes are visible, external nodes are hidden
3. **Given** user is viewing the internal structure of a composite node, **When** user clicks "Exit" button or breadcrumb navigation, **Then** view returns to main canvas showing the composite node
4. **Given** user is in drill-down view, **When** user inspects the node positions and connections, **Then** the layout matches how nodes were arranged when originally composed

---

### User Story 5 - Manage Composite Node Representation (Priority: P3)

Users can see clear visual distinction of composite nodes, view their internal component list in the footer, and understand their aggregated input/output structure.

**Why this priority**: Important for long-term usability but not essential for MVP. Composition can work with basic representation initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by examining a created composite node and verifying footer content, input/output labels, and visual styling without requiring further composition actions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a composite node exists, **When** user views the node, **Then** the footer displays a list of component names that were composed together
2. **Given** a composite node has 3 inputs and 2 outputs, **When** user views the node, **Then** inputs are labeled according to their source node context and outputs are labeled according to their destination context
3. **Given** a composite node is displayed, **When** user views it alongside regular nodes, **Then** composite node has distinct visual styling (border, color, or icon) indicating it is a composition

### Edge Cases

- What happens when selected nodes form disconnected subgraphs (no connections between some selected nodes)? Answer: Composition should fail with error message per FR-013
- What happens if user tries to select nodes while a node is currently executing?
- How does the system behave when user drags selection rectangle partially off-canvas?
- What happens when composite node inputs/outputs have naming conflicts (multiple inputs with same name)?
- How does the system handle composition of nodes that have errors or invalid configurations?
- What happens when user attempts to compose a composite node with other nodes (nested composition)?
- What happens if user is in drill-down view and the parent composite node is deleted from main canvas by another operation?
- How does the system handle drill-down when composite node contains another composite node (if nested composition is supported in future)?
- What happens if user attempts to modify connections or execute nodes while in drill-down view?
- How does the system navigate back if user drills into multiple levels of nested composite nodes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to initiate rectangle selection by clicking and dragging on empty canvas area
- **FR-002**: System MUST highlight all nodes whose bounding boxes intersect with the selection rectangle during dragging
- **FR-003**: System MUST finalize selection when user releases mouse button, keeping all intersecting nodes selected
- **FR-004**: System MUST clear previous selection when starting a new rectangle selection without modifier keys
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a user action (button, menu, or keyboard shortcut) to trigger composition of selected nodes
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate that at least 2 nodes are selected before allowing composition
- **FR-007**: System MUST analyze selected nodes to determine which inputs are exposed (not internally connected) and which outputs are exposed (not internally consumed)
- **FR-008**: System MUST create a new composite node with aggregated exposed inputs and outputs when composition is triggered
- **FR-009**: System MUST display a footer on composite nodes listing all component names included in the composition
- **FR-010**: System MUST remove original nodes from the main canvas after successful composition and transfer their external connections to the composite node
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual distinction between regular nodes and composite nodes (styling, icon, or border)
- **FR-012**: System MUST validate that selected nodes form a connected subgraph (all nodes must be reachable from each other through connections) before allowing composition
- **FR-013**: System MUST display appropriate error message when user attempts to compose nodes that do not form a connected subgraph
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow users to drill into a composite node to view its internal structure in a separate layer view
- **FR-015**: System MUST display only the composed nodes (and their internal connections) when user is in drill-down view, hiding all external nodes
- **FR-016**: System MUST provide a clear user action (button, breadcrumb, or gesture) to exit the drill-down view and return to main canvas
- **FR-017**: System MUST preserve the internal node layout and connections within the composite node when entering drill-down view
- **FR-018**: System MUST cancel selection rectangle if user presses escape key during drag
- **FR-019**: System MUST show real-time rectangle outline while user is dragging

### Key Entities

- **Selection Rectangle**: Represents the temporary visual rectangle drawn by user, defined by start point and current mouse position, used to determine which nodes fall within bounds
- **Composite Node**: A special node type representing multiple composed nodes, contains references to internal component nodes, exposed inputs/outputs, component list for footer display, and preserved internal layout
- **Node Selection State**: Tracks which nodes are currently selected, supports operations like clear, add, remove, and query
- **Drill-Down View**: A separate layer view that displays the internal structure of a composite node, showing only the composed nodes and their connections, isolated from the main canvas
- **View Navigation Context**: Tracks the current view level (main canvas vs drill-down) and provides navigation path back to parent views

## Assumptions

- Users are familiar with rectangle selection paradigm from other graphical applications (drag to select)
- Users understand the concept of drilling down into hierarchical structures (similar to folder navigation)
- The existing node editor supports visual styling modifications to distinguish node types
- The existing node editor supports multiple view layers or contexts for drill-down functionality
- WAC (WebAssembly Composition) tool is available and accessible for performing actual component composition
- Node graph structure maintains connection information that can be analyzed programmatically for connectivity validation
- Composite nodes can be treated as regular nodes for connection and execution purposes after creation
- Default behavior is to use standard mouse (left-click drag) for rectangle selection without requiring modifier keys
- Composition is a one-time snapshot operation, but internal structure is preserved and viewable via drill-down
- Original composed nodes are stored within the composite node, not deleted from the system
- Connected subgraph validation can be performed efficiently using graph traversal algorithms

## Dependencies

- WAC (WebAssembly Composition) tool for actual component composition logic
- Existing node editor framework must support custom node rendering for composite node footer
- Existing node editor framework must support view layering or context switching for drill-down functionality
- Graph data structure must support querying connections between nodes and graph traversal for connectivity validation
- Event system must support mouse drag operations on canvas
- Event system must support double-click or other drill-down trigger interactions

## Out of Scope

- Decomposing composite nodes back into individual nodes on main canvas (future feature)
- Editing internal structure of composite nodes while in drill-down view (view is read-only for this feature)
- Multiple levels of nested composition (composing composite nodes with other nodes)
- Saving/loading composite node definitions across sessions (unless part of existing graph save functionality)
- Cross-selection with keyboard modifiers (Ctrl+click, Shift+click) for adding/removing individual nodes
- Executing nodes while in drill-down view (execution only happens on main canvas)
- Real-time updates to composite node when external connections change
