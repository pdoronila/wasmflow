# Specification Quality Checklist: Rectangle Selection Tool for Node Composition

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)
**Last Validated**: 2025-10-21

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All quality criteria met

**Clarifications Resolved**:
1. Original node removal strategy: Remove from canvas, preserve in composite node, enable drill-down view
2. Composition compatibility: Nodes must form connected subgraph

**Key Additions from Clarification**:
- Added User Story 4 for drill-down functionality (Priority P2)
- Added FR-014 through FR-017 for drill-down view requirements
- Added FR-012 and FR-013 for connected subgraph validation
- Updated assumptions to include drill-down support and connectivity validation
- Updated out of scope to clarify read-only drill-down view

## Notes

✅ All checklist items complete. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
