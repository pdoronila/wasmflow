- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review
✅ **PASSED**: The specification focuses entirely on WHAT users need and WHY, with no implementation details about Rust, wasmtime, or specific code structures. All technical references are in the Dependencies section where appropriate.

✅ **PASSED**: Written in user-centric language focusing on building pipelines and processing data. Business value is clear for each priority level.

✅ **PASSED**: Language is accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Technical terms (WASM, WIT) are used minimally and only when necessary for naming.

✅ **PASSED**: All mandatory sections (User Scenarios & Testing, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete with substantial content.

### Requirement Completeness Review
✅ **PASSED**: No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present. All requirements are concrete and specific.

✅ **PASSED**: Every functional requirement can be tested:
- FR-004: "string-concat component that accepts multiple string inputs and outputs a single joined string" - Testable by providing inputs and verifying concatenated output
- FR-022: "list-get component that retrieves an element at a specified index" - Testable by providing list and index, verifying correct element returned
- All other requirements follow similar testable patterns

✅ **PASSED**: Success criteria are measurable:
- SC-001: "results appearing in under 1 second per operation" - Measurable timing
- SC-004: "at least 10,000 elements without performance degradation (operations complete in under 100ms)" - Measurable size and timing
- SC-005: "80% of cases" - Measurable percentage
- SC-007: "All 35+ components load successfully" - Measurable count

✅ **PASSED**: Success criteria are technology-agnostic:
- Focus on user experience ("Users can create...", "Users can discover...")
- Performance metrics from user perspective ("results appearing in under 1 second")
- No mention of specific technologies (API response times, database performance, framework specifics)

✅ **PASSED**: Each user story has 4-5 acceptance scenarios in Given-When-Then format covering the main operations for that category.

✅ **PASSED**: Edge cases section identifies 7 potential boundary conditions and error scenarios across all component categories.

✅ **PASSED**: Out of Scope section clearly defines what is NOT included. In Scope is defined through the 37 functional requirements.

✅ **PASSED**: Dependencies section lists 4 required systems. Assumptions section documents 8 technical and design assumptions.

### Feature Readiness Review
✅ **PASSED**: Each of the 37 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in the user stories. For example:
- FR-004 (string-concat) → User Story 1, Scenario 2
- FR-011 (compare) → User Story 2, Scenario 1
- FR-015 (math-power) → User Story 3, Scenario 1

✅ **PASSED**: Five user stories cover the complete feature scope:
- P1: String operations (most fundamental)
- P2: Comparison and logic (validation workflows)
- P3: Math operations (numerical processing)
- P4: List operations (batch processing)
- P5: Data transformation (interoperability)

✅ **PASSED**: Success criteria define measurable outcomes:
- SC-001-004: Performance targets for each category
- SC-005-006: Usability metrics
- SC-007-008: Reliability metrics

✅ **PASSED**: No implementation details in requirements. The Dependencies section appropriately lists required systems but doesn't dictate HOW to implement. Assumptions document reasonable defaults without prescribing implementation.

## Notes

Specification is complete and ready for planning. All quality criteria met. No clarifications needed - the user provided comprehensive details about component categories, operations, and directory structure.

The specification successfully balances:
- **User Focus**: Clear user stories showing value delivery
- **Completeness**: 37 functional requirements covering 35+ components
- **Testability**: Each requirement and scenario is verifiable
- **Clarity**: No ambiguous or under-specified areas
- **Scope Management**: Clear boundaries with Out of Scope section

**Recommendation**: Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to generate implementation plan.
