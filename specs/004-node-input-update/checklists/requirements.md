# Specification Quality Checklist: Four-Section Node Layout

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-16
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed after incorporating body and footer default/custom view clarifications. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details - Updated 2025-10-16 (Final)

**Content Quality**: PASS
- Specification uses technology-agnostic language throughout
- Focused on user needs (visual separation, default views with customization, status monitoring)
- No mention of specific frameworks, languages, or APIs
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: PASS
- All functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-015) are testable with clear expected behaviors
- Success criteria include measurable metrics (100% accuracy, 90% task completion, 5 seconds)
- All success criteria are technology-agnostic and user-focused
- Three prioritized user stories with independent acceptance scenarios
- Ten edge cases identified (including body and footer default/custom behavior edge cases)
- Scope is clearly bounded to the four-section layout structure with default and custom views
- Twelve assumptions documented (including body and footer default and custom behavior)

**Feature Readiness**: PASS
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User stories cover the three main flows: viewing connections (P1), default/custom body (P2), and default/custom footer (P3)
- Success criteria align with user stories and functional requirements
- No implementation details in specification

### Updates Applied

**Final Update - Body Default/Custom View**:
- User Story 2 updated to clarify default body shows input fields for parameters, with custom body as override
- User Story 3 updated to clarify default footer shows dynamic status, with custom footer as override
- FR-006, FR-007, FR-008, FR-009 added to distinguish default body vs custom body behavior
- FR-010, FR-011, FR-012 updated to distinguish default footer vs custom footer behavior
- Added 3 edge cases related to body content (reversion, parameter selection, complex types)
- Added 2 edge cases related to footer content (reversion, parameter selection)
- Added 3 assumptions about default body content, custom body replacement, and input field behavior
- Added 2 assumptions about default footer content and custom footer replacement behavior
