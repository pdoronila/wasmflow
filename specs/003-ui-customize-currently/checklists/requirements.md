# Specification Quality Checklist: Component-Driven Custom UI Views

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

**Status**: PASSED
**Validation Date**: 2025-10-15

### Review Notes

The specification successfully meets all quality criteria:

1. **Content Quality**: The spec focuses on WHAT users need (component-driven custom views, colocation of logic) and WHY (better code organization, maintainability), without specifying HOW to implement it.

2. **Requirement Completeness**: All 10 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "within 100 milliseconds", "at least 10 different component types", "100% of view rendering errors"). No clarification markers needed as the requirements have reasonable defaults.

3. **Feature Readiness**: Three prioritized user stories (P1, P2, P3) provide independent test paths. Each story includes clear acceptance scenarios in Given/When/Then format. Edge cases cover error handling, performance, and UI constraints.

4. **Technology Agnostic**: Success criteria avoid implementation details (no mention of specific UI frameworks, rendering engines, or technical architecture). Metrics focus on user-observable outcomes.

## Notes

- Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify`
- No blocking issues identified
- All assumptions documented (existing architecture, footer area, UI rendering capabilities)
- Scope clearly defines what's included and excluded
