# Feature Specification: Component-Driven Custom UI Views

**Feature Branch**: `003-ui-customize-currently`
**Created**: 2025-10-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "ui-customize Currently we have one node that has a custom view to be rendered in the footer. I think the specific component should provide an interface view() for the canvas to call. This allows the custom view to be colocated with the componet logic."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Component Provides Custom Footer View (Priority: P1)

As a component developer, when I create a node component that needs custom visualization in the canvas footer area, I want to define that view within the component itself so that all related logic stays together in one place.

**Why this priority**: This is the core architectural change that enables better code organization and maintainability. Without this, custom views remain tightly coupled to the canvas rendering logic.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a single component with a custom view method and verifying the canvas calls that method to render the footer. Delivers immediate value by demonstrating the new interface pattern works.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component implements a custom view interface, **When** the component is selected on the canvas, **Then** the canvas calls the component's view method to render the footer content
2. **Given** a component implements a custom view interface, **When** the component's view method returns UI elements, **Then** those elements are displayed in the footer area
3. **Given** a component does not implement a custom view interface, **When** the component is selected, **Then** the footer displays default or no custom content

### User Story 2 - Multiple Components with Different Custom Views (Priority: P2)

As a user working with multiple node types on the canvas, when I select different nodes that each have custom views, I want to see the appropriate custom visualization for each selected node so that I can interact with node-specific controls and information.

**Why this priority**: Validates that the interface pattern scales to support multiple different component types. Essential for real-world usage but depends on P1 working first.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating 2-3 different component types with distinct custom views, selecting each in turn, and verifying the correct view is displayed. Demonstrates the pattern works for diverse component needs.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the canvas has nodes of different types with different custom views, **When** I select a node of type A, **Then** the footer shows type A's custom view
2. **Given** the footer is showing node A's custom view, **When** I select a different node of type B, **Then** the footer updates to show type B's custom view
3. **Given** I have selected a node with a custom view, **When** I deselect it, **Then** the footer clears or shows default content

### User Story 3 - Component Updates Reflected in Custom View (Priority: P3)

As a component developer, when the internal state of my component changes during runtime, I want the custom view in the footer to automatically reflect those changes so that users see live updates to component data and controls.

**Why this priority**: Enhances the user experience with dynamic updates but is not required for the basic interface pattern to work. Can be implemented after the static view pattern is established.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by creating a component that exposes mutable state (e.g., a counter or configuration value), modifying that state, and verifying the footer view updates accordingly. Demonstrates the interface supports reactive updates.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a component with a custom view is selected, **When** the component's internal state changes, **Then** the custom view in the footer reflects the updated state
2. **Given** the custom view displays editable controls, **When** a user interacts with those controls, **Then** the component's state updates accordingly
3. **Given** a component updates rapidly (e.g., data streaming), **When** the view is visible, **Then** the footer updates smoothly without performance degradation

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a component's view method fails or throws an error during rendering?
- How does the system handle a component that provides an extremely large or complex custom view that doesn't fit in the footer area?
- What happens when multiple nodes are selected simultaneously - which custom view should be displayed?
- How does the system handle components that provide no custom view versus components that explicitly provide an empty view?
- What happens if a component's view method takes a long time to execute - does it block the UI thread?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Components MUST be able to optionally implement a view interface/method that the canvas can query
- **FR-002**: The canvas MUST detect whether a selected component provides a custom view interface
- **FR-003**: The canvas MUST call the component's view method when rendering the footer area for that component
- **FR-004**: Components without a custom view MUST NOT cause errors when selected (graceful fallback to default behavior)
- **FR-005**: The system MUST support multiple different component types each providing their own distinct custom views
- **FR-006**: Custom views MUST be rendered in the canvas footer area when the associated component is selected
- **FR-007**: The system MUST clear or update the footer view when selection changes from one component to another
- **FR-008**: Component developers MUST be able to define their view logic in the same module/file as the component logic
- **FR-009**: The view interface MUST support displaying interactive UI elements (buttons, inputs, text, etc.)
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle view rendering errors gracefully without crashing the application

### Key Entities

- **Component**: A node type that can optionally provide a custom view. Contains business logic and optionally a view() method for rendering custom UI.
- **Custom View**: The UI representation returned by a component's view() method. Contains layout and interactive elements specific to that component type.
- **Canvas**: The rendering surface that displays nodes and calls component view() methods to render footer content based on the current selection.
- **Footer Area**: The designated region in the canvas where custom component views are displayed.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Component developers can add new components with custom views without modifying canvas rendering code
- **SC-002**: When a component with a custom view is selected, the footer displays that view within 100 milliseconds
- **SC-003**: The application supports at least 10 different component types each with unique custom views without performance degradation
- **SC-004**: 100% of view rendering errors are caught and handled without application crashes
- **SC-005**: Users can successfully interact with controls in custom views and see immediate feedback
- **SC-006**: Code reviews confirm that component logic and view logic are colocated in the same files (measured by file organization compliance)

## Assumptions

- The existing node/component architecture supports adding optional interface methods
- The canvas already has a designated footer area for rendering custom content
- Components have access to UI rendering capabilities (widgets, layouts, etc.)
- The current system with "one node that has a custom view" serves as the prototype/reference implementation
- Performance requirements assume desktop/native application context (not constrained by browser limitations)
- The footer area has sufficient space for typical custom views (scrolling or overflow handling is acceptable)

## Scope

### In Scope

- Defining the view interface that components can implement
- Modifying the canvas to detect and call component view methods
- Migrating the existing custom view node to use the new interface pattern
- Supporting multiple component types with different custom views
- Error handling for view rendering failures
- Documentation for component developers on implementing custom views

### Out of Scope

- Changing the location or size of the footer area
- Implementing specific custom views for multiple components (only migration of the existing one and pattern validation)
- Advanced layout management or view composition patterns beyond basic rendering
- Performance optimization beyond graceful handling of typical use cases
- Persistence or serialization of custom view state (separate from component state)
- Multi-selection custom view aggregation (edge case to be addressed later if needed)
